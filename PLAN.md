# Outline (for now)
* Find out some basic knowledge of what the Hamiltonian equations are 
* How they are constructed and what they are used for 
* What the SIS epidemic model is 
* Try to recreate some code that was used in a study by Nakamura and Martinez in 2019
* Understand both the math for the SIS model and the code that is used to graphically represent the model
